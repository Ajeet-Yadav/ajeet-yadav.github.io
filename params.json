Research Intern at <a href=\"http://robotics.iiit.ac.in/\">Robotics Research Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.iiit.ac.in/\">IIIT Hyderabad</a>. Former Secretary at Robotics Club, IIT Guwahati. \r\nRoboticist, tech-savvy innovator, excited by electrons. \r\n\r\n\r\nFeatured pages: <a href=\"/research/\">Research page</a> | <a href=\"/robots/\">DIY Robot hacks</a> | <a href=\"/assets/RISHABH_JANGIR_CV.pdf\">Curriculum Vitae</a>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/assets/home/main.png\" width=\"100%\"></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\r\nMy major contributions and interests are in the application oriented extensions of robotics, artificial intelligence and computer vision. I have a personal motivation towards soft reconfigurable robotics and internet of things.\r\nI am actively involved in the Robotics Research Center of IIIT Hyderabad as a Researcher under <b>Dr. K Madhava Krishna</b>. I am doing research in my bachelors' thesis project under <b>Dr. Prithwijit Guha</b>, IIT Guwahati. As a researcher I have intensively worked on:\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"0px\"cellspacing=\"40px\">\r\n  <tr align=\"left\">\r\n    <td><b><u>Reinforcement Learning</u></b></td>\r\n    <td><b><u>Learning from Demonstration</u></b></td>\r\n    <td><b><u>Inverse Reinforcement Learning</u></b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr align=\"left\">\r\n    <td><b><u>Visual navigation and SLAM</u></b></td>\r\n    <td><b><u>Monocular SLAM systems</u></b></td>\r\n    <td><b><u>Autonomous Aerial Vehicles</u></b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr align=\"left\">\r\n    <td><b><u>3D stereo reconstruction</b></u></td>\r\n    <td> Visit <a href=\"/research/\">Research page</a> to read more. </td>\r\n    \r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">My recent work has strengthened my belief towards artificial intelligence and its application in the field of robotics, I believe that some of the very challenging problems in robotics can be tackled through machine intelligence. My current research interests revolve around <b>deep reinforcement learning, multi robot co-ordination</b> and <b>human-robot interaction.</b><br></br>\r\n\r\nOver the course of my undergraduate studies I squeezed in three internships, two internships in computer vision and robotics at the above mentioned lab and one internship in IoT and embedded systems at a startup, SimpleLabs, where I worked on wireless data transfer protocols and networks in <b>bluetooth low energy</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">One of the best experiences in my undergraduate college life has been my involvement with the Robotics Club, IIT Guwahati. I headed the chair as the Secretary, Robotics Club 2015-16, leading a team of over 50 undergraduate students to work on a multitude of projects throughout the year. Visit <a href=\"/club/\">page</a> to know more. During my term I was actively involved in conducting lectures and workshops in my college community and organizing various competitions. \r\n<br></br>\r\n<div class=\"imgcap\">\r\n<center><img src=\"/assets/home/me.png\" width=\"100%\"></center>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">On a side for fun I <a href=\"/theBlog/\">blog</a>, tweet, take part in Hackathons and build robots!
