My major contributions and interests are in the application oriented extensions of robotics, artificial intelligence and computer vision. I have a personal motivation towards soft reconfigurable robotics and internet of things.
I am actively involved in the Robotics Research Center of IIIT Hyderabad as a Researcher under <b>Dr. K Madhava Krishna</b>. I am doing research in my bachelors' thesis project under <b>Dr. Prithwijit Guha</b>, IIT Guwahati. As a researcher I have intensively worked on:

<p>My recent work has strengthened my belief towards artificial intelligence and its application in the field of robotics, I believe that some of the very challenging problems in robotics can be tackled through machine intelligence. My current research interests revolve around <b>deep reinforcement learning, multi robot co-ordination</b> and <b>human-robot interaction.</b><br>

Over the course of my undergraduate studies I squeezed in three internships, two internships in computer vision and robotics at the above mentioned lab and one internship in IoT and embedded systems at a startup, SimpleLabs, where I worked on wireless data transfer protocols and networks in <b>bluetooth low energy</b>.</p>

<p>One of the best experiences in my undergraduate college life has been my involvement with the Robotics Club, IIT Guwahati. I headed the chair as the Secretary, Robotics Club 2015-16, leading a team of over 50 undergraduate students to work on a multitude of projects throughout the year. Visit <a href="/club/">page</a> to know more. During my term I was actively involved in conducting lectures and workshops in my college community and organizing various competitions.
