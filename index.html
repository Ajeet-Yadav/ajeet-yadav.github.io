<p>This is Homepage of my website.</p>

<p> I am Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) from <a href="http://www.msit.in/">MSIT</a>, Delhi majoring in Computer Science. Research Intern at <a href="http:/Unisys.com/">Unisys</a> Research Center and Engineering intern at <a href="https://www.airtel.in/">Bharti Airtel</a>, Gurgaon. </p>

My major contributions and interests are in the application oriented extensions of artificial intelligence and driverless vehicle. I have a personal motivation towards Learinng alogrithm and internet of things.
I am involved in Unisys Research Center at Bengaluru as a Research intern under <b> Nandish J Kopri</b>. I am did research in my bachelors' thesis project under <b>Prof.Pooja Kherwa</b>, MSIT, Delhi. As a Student I have intensively worked on:

<p>My recent work has strengthened my belief towards Machine learning intelligence and its application in the field of AI, I believe that some of the very challenging problems in robotics can be tackled through machine intelligence. My current research interests revolve around <b>deep reinforcement learning, multi robot co-ordination</b> and <b>human-robot interaction.</b><br>

Over the course of my undergraduate studies I squeezed in three internships, two internships in computer vision and robotics at the above mentioned lab and one internship in IoT and embedded systems at a startup, SimpleLabs, where I worked on wireless data transfer protocols and networks in <b>bluetooth low energy</b>.</p>

<p>One of the best experiences in my undergraduate college life has been my involvement with the Club.
